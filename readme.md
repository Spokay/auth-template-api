## AuthTemplate API

This repository is a template for REST API Authentication and Authorization.

The purpose of this project was to be used in my future school projects, in any project requiring an authentication system.

Currently, it uses a simple in memory database, and I plan to add Spring Profiles for multiple types of Authentication.

## The profiles available for now are:

- <span style='color:green;'>Default</span> : Authentication verifications with an in memory database, no authorization is implemented
- <span style='color:green;'>Jwt</span> : Uses JWT tokens for Authentication, Authorization 


# this is a change to test some stuff
